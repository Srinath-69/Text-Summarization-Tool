*DESCRIPTION*:

The Text Summarization Tool is a state-of-the-art computer program that employs Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to produce summaries automatically in a short and informative way from large text sources. This tool is particularly designed to assist users in finding key information from texts, articles, reports, or any other unstructured text format without the need for extensive reading of the entire content. With the vast explosion of digital content at a faster rate, it has been becoming ever more challenging for individuals to keep up with handling voluminous amounts of information effectively. This tool offers an appropriate solution by condensing voluminous texts into their most essential points, thus facilitating faster understanding and improved decision-making.

Text summarization can broadly be divided into two types, i.e., extractive and abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization is done by searching and copying important sentences, phrases, or sections from the source text without modifying it. Abstractive summarization is done by utilizing deep learning models to scan the context of the source text and generate new sentences that represent the key ideas, imitating the way a human being would write a summary.

The utility integrates a set of contemporary technologies and libraries to obtain improved accuracy and effectiveness. Key technologies employed in the process are Python as the programming language, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), spaCy, Transformers (Hugging Face), and TextRank for extractive processes. With abstractive processes, pre-trained models such as BART, T5, and GPT-based transformers are used to create summaries in human-readable writing style. The utility offers the flexibility to users to select either one of the two modes of summary generation based on their suitability and the type of content.
The software is built in Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a feature-rich and widely used source code editor. VS Code offers features like intelligent code completion, a built-in terminal, Git integration, and many extensions that significantly help in the efficiency of the development process. The modular structure of the project allows for simple updates and integration with different applications, e.g., chatbots, content management systems, or learning platforms.

From the user experience point of view, the app has an intuitive interface through which users can copy and paste or upload documents, choose the summarization option (extractive or abstractive), and produce a summary with one click. It is also designed to support input in various formats such as plain text, PDF, and Word documents, thus being versatile and adaptable to users with varying needs.
